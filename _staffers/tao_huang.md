Hello, everyone! My name is Tao Huang and I am excited to be serving as a Teaching Assistant for CSW8. I am a first master student here
and have a passion for computer graphics. I have been involved in some rendering research projects for three years. 

As a TA, I am here to help you succeed in this course by answering your questions, providing 
feedback on your work, and supporting your learning journey. I am looking forward to working with you throughout the quarter!
