Hey everyone, hope you all are doing well! I am currently a graduate student in the CS department.
I have 6 years of experience working with Python (3 through the industry where I worked as a full stack developer).
I have used python in the most systematic way in an organization to the most hacky way to monitor if a new movie has opened up in the theatres.
I have used python pre-dominantly for data analysis, scripting as part of a hedge fund to generate time critical reports, machine learning, deep learning, data visualization and backend development.
I am always enthusiastic to project and teach what I understand and at the same time learn from you all with your intriguing questions and have interesting conversations about it.
I have explored different areas of computer science in cross section with finance and product development and have many cool experiences to share with you all.
I always believe in a productive and healthy conversation/debate on any doubts for better understanding involving real-time use cases and I will try my best to keep things engaging.
Feel free to reach out to me for any queries with respect to anything and I will be happy to help.
Looking forward to meeting you all and getting to know better and hope you all have great learnings with this course!
May the Force be with you!!!
