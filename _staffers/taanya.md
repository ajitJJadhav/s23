Hello everyone, welcome to CSW8! My name is Taanya and I am a 1st year masters student in the Computer Science Department. My strong foundation for python
programming language comes through the projects that I have worked in the domain of Machine Learning and Data Analytics. I have a strong passion for Distributed Systems.

This course will introduce you to programming fundamentals using Python. As a beginner it can be overwhelming in the initial phase. But I am sure you are going to enjoy the course
and be in a good place wrt Python Programming by the end. Please feel free to reach out for any queries.
