==> See this site for the example bios and the info that you can include: 
<https://ucsb-teaching-cs.github.io/s21/staff>.
Use it as an inspiration to write your bio and select a picture that you'd like to share with students.

==> Please follow the steps outlined on this website <https://ucsb-teaching-cs.github.io/s21/hw/adding_bio/> to add your picture and the bio to our website 
* no need to use the same naming convention for the picture; you can just use `FirstName-LastInitial.png`. (please don't use .tiff or .bmp)
* please make sure that your picture is square and that you are clearly visible (let me know if you do not want your picture posted)
* In the instructions, a `PROJECT_REPO` refers to our GitHub repository (repo) that hosts our course website: https://github.com/ucsb-csw8/w23k

==> use the templated bio file in the this (`_staffers`) folder (it's called `_example.md`): 
copy its contents into a new .md file named the same as your NetID.
