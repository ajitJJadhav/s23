Hey everyone! Welcome to CS8! My name is Wesley Kam and I am a third year undergraduate student. I am interested in many computer science fields like machine learning and web development, but everythng leads back to my love for solving problems. Coding may seem intimidating at first, but my hope is that you will all learn to see it as a fun puzzle. I have experience with most of the popular coding languages like C++, Java, and Javascript, but Python is by far my favorite as it is one of the more intuitive and powerful languages out there.
  
Outside of academics, I enjoy staying active by playing sports or running. I also love video games and cooking/eating yummy foods. I am excited to be a ULA for this course and I look forward to meeting all of you!
