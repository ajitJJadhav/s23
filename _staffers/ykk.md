Hi everyone! I am really excited about teaching this class again, since every time we offer it, we add new ways to present the introductory Computer Science concepts in a more intuitive, fun and/or creative way. 

When I am not sharing my passion for Computer Science and Data Science, you can find me drinking copious amounts of tea and exploring various hobbies, such as learning how to draw on my tablet.

This term, I'm going to be on the other side of the world (12 time zones ahead of Santa Barbara), but I look forward to connecting with all of you and helping you learn.
