Hi everyone! I am a first-year master's student in the Computer Science department. I also got my Bachelor's degree from UCSB. This is my second time being the TA for CSW8. I am very excited to work with you all this quarter. If you have any questions, like how to take the online course, course content, or other CS courses at UCSB, you can always come and ask me:)

This course is an introductory coding class. You may feel like overwhelming at the beginning of the course. Please be confident in yourself and I am here to help you all.

In my free time, I like traveling with my family and friend. I always look forward to finding new things during my trip. I am looking forward to knowing you all!
