Hi everyone, welcome to CS8! I'm Lucas, currently a Masters student in the CS department. My research interests are in general cybersecurity topics and vulnerability detection/mitigation; I love learning about how systems work and how to break them (as a way to make them more secure!). I've been at UCSB for almost 5 years now (did undergrad here as well), so I'm always happy to answer any questions and share anything I've learned along the way. 

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, playing tennis, and playing various board and card games. I'm also an avid chess player, so I'm always down for a game :)

Looking forward to working with you all throughout this quarter!
